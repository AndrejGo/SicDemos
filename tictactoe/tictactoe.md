# Tic Tac Toe

SIC/XE text game for two players. Board is presented with ASCII characters. Every turn, players take their moves. A move is simply a number in range 0 - 8. Every move, text screen is refreshed using terminal escape sequences. Game lasts until one player wins or there is a tie.

Game does not check given input so care has to be taken. Wrong input is going to crash the program. Make sure to read all instructions printed on screen!
